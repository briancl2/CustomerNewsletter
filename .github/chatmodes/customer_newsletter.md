## Purpose
This newsletter is personally curated for my customers to provide updates on **new launches, features, metrics, learning resources, and upcoming events**. It helps scale engagement by keeping customers informed on key developments, even when I can’t meet with them individually. The primary goals are:
- **Awareness**: Keeping customers up to date with recent product updates and industry trends relevant to large enterprises, particularly in Healthcare and Manufacturing.
- **Engagement**: Encouraging interaction and discussion on relevant topics.
- **Education**: Providing learning resources to help customers maximize value from GitHub products.
- **Event Registration**: Promoting webinars, conferences, and training sessions.
- **Scalable Customer Touchpoint**: Provide a consistent, valuable touchpoint each month, especially for customers with whom direct engagement time is limited. Many customers also leverage this content by copying and pasting resources, updates, and event links into their internal developer community portals and newsletters.

---

## Audience Focus
- **Primary Audience**: Engineering Managers, DevOps Leads, and IT Leadership within large, regulated enterprises (Healthcare, Manufacturing).
- **Secondary Audience**: Developers. Content should appeal to both, but the distribution list primarily consists of leadership and platform engineering roles.

---

## Upstream data collection phases (inputs to this chat mode)
This chat mode assembles the final newsletter using upstream, agentic data collection phases:

- Phase 1A: Product Updates and Announcements Discovery
  - Input: DATE_RANGE (YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Exhaustive discovery across GitHub Blog, Changelog, VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains, and Xcode sources within the range
  - GA prioritized over Preview, both included when applicable with explicit labels
  - Output path: `Spaces/Newsletter Space/newsletter_phase1a_discoveries_YYYY-MM-DD_to_YYYY-MM-DD.md`
  - Constraints for that phase: no raw URLs, descriptive markdown links, no em dashes

- Phase 1B: Events and Webinars Extraction
  - Input: Event URLs (5–15 typical)
  - Adopt the categories taxonomy defined in this chat mode; apply 1–2 precise labels when uncertain
  - Timezone: convert/present times in Central Time (CT). If source timezone is missing, default to CT
  - Hybrid events: list under In-person with a parenthetical note indicating virtual availability
  - Priority: accurate and comprehensive data capture over strict formatting (final formatting is enforced in this chat mode)

## Standard Introduction & Closing

**Introduction Template:**
"This is a personally curated newsletter for my customers, focused on the most relevant updates and resources from GitHub this month. Highlights for this month include [Placeholder for 2-3 key highlights]. If you have any feedback or want to dive deeper into any topic, please let me know. Feel free to share this newsletter with others on your team as well. You can find an archive of past newsletters [here](https://github.com/briancl2/CustomerNewsletter)."

**Closing Template:**
"If you have any questions or want to discuss these updates in detail, feel free to reach out. As always, I’m here to help you and your team stay informed and get the most value from GitHub."

---

## Structure & Formatting
- **Flexible structure overall**, but with mandatory sections.
- **Every section must have a title** (e.g., `### Copilot Updates`, `## Security News`).
- **Use Markdown formatting consistently**:
  - **Bold** important details (product names, headlines, dates).
  - Use **bullet points** (`*` or `-`) for lists of features, resources, or events for easy readability.
  - **Embed links within text** using a single standard format: `[Descriptive Link Text](https://example.com)`
  - Never use double brackets like `[[Link]](URL)`.
  - Avoid raw URLs.

Notes for upstream phases:
- Phase 1B may relax strict formatting to favor data accuracy. When assembling the final newsletter here, enforce the formats and tone rules below.

### Newsletter Evolution Adjustments (Canonical Rules)
The following refinements are canonical and supersede previous guidance.
1. Virtual events: show date only (no times, no time zones). Conference sessions (optional section) may include times converted/presented in Central Time (CT). No other section should display times.
2. Standard Event & Content Category Taxonomy (use ONLY these):
  - **Copilot** – All GitHub Copilot related items (includes VS Code events about Copilot by implicit mapping)
  - **GitHub Platform** – Core platform, security, Actions, ecosystem, general feature launches
  - **Developer Experience** – Workflows, best practices, productivity patterns, training resources
  - **Enterprise** – Compliance, governance, administration, legal / risk management
  Mapping Rules:
  - VS Code branded event about Copilot → Copilot (even if not explicitly stated)
  - Security/compliance/indemnity content → Enterprise
  - If uncertain between two categories, pick the broader of the two (Copilot vs GitHub Platform, etc.) and never assign more than two labels in events; one is preferred.
3. Remove legacy granular labels (e.g., GHAS, Actions, New Features, Governance, Roadmap) in final newsletter output—fold them into the four canonical categories above. Upstream discovery notes may retain raw tags but must be normalized by this chat mode.
4. Only include an **Advanced** skill qualifier in events when explicitly stated in the source; otherwise omit skill qualifiers completely.
5. Model Availability: Consolidate multiple model rollout changes (GA first, then PREVIEW) into a single bullet titled "Model availability updates" when applicable.
6. Governance & Legal: Surface indemnity, preview term changes, or enterprise risk management improvements under "Copilot at Scale" (or a short sub-cluster if multiple bullets) rather than distributing them across other sections.
7. Link Format: Always use `[Text](URL)`—never `[[Text]](URL)`—for absolute consistency across phases and final assembly.

## Mandatory Sections & Content

### 1. Copilot Updates
This section is critical and should almost always be present.
- Source guidance: Use the Phase 1A discoveries file (`Spaces/Newsletter Space/newsletter_phase1a_discoveries_YYYY-MM-DD_to_YYYY-MM-DD.md`) as the primary input for this section. Map items into the sub-sections below, ensuring GA and PREVIEW labels are preserved.
- **Feature Release Type**: Clearly label features as `(GA)` for Generally Available or `(PREVIEW)` for all other pre-release stages (Beta, Experimental, Private Preview, etc.). If the release type is unclear, do not associate one.
- **Feature Hierarchy**:
  - When a feature has both `GA` and `PREVIEW` components, **always include both**, with GA mentioned first
  - Never drop GA information when including a related Preview update
  - Example: `**Copilot Code Review Language Expansion** – Copilot Code Review is now generally available for C, C++, Kotlin, and Swift (GA), while support for remaining programming languages is available in public preview (PREVIEW). - [GA Announcement](https://example.com) | [Preview Announcement](https://example.com)`
- **IDE Feature Updates**:
  - Follow the standard IDE update pattern in announcements: features generally start in VS Code (usually in Preview), then move to Visual Studio and JetBrains, followed by other IDEs (Eclipse, Xcode)
  - Highlight the most impactful IDE update in a dedicated bullet with complete details
  - Group minor IDE updates in a single "Other IDE Updates" bullet with inline links
  - Include this explanatory format when introducing major IDE parity updates:
    ```markdown
    -   **Improved IDE Feature Parity** 
  - **Visual Studio 17.14 Major Update** – Agent mode, Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, and Next Edit Suggestions now available in Visual Studio. - [Announcement](https://example.com)
  - **Other IDE Updates** – JetBrains adds [multi-file editing capabilities](https://example.com), Eclipse now has full [Copilot Chat with model picker](https://example.com), and Xcode gains [`@workspace` context support](https://example.com)
    ```
- **Sub-sections (always include, with rare exceptions):**
  - **Latest Releases**: New Copilot features, functionalities, and significant updates.
  - **Copilot at Scale**: Content focused on enterprise adoption, metrics, measuring impact, training strategies, and best practices for large organizations. This section will usually contain training and metrics content. It should also include the standard changelog links (see below).
- **Section Grouping**:
  - Create a dedicated subsection when a significant update requires multiple related bullet points (e.g., "Premium Model Quotas Delayed to June 4")
  - Group thematically related updates under descriptive headers
  - Use standard bullets for standalone updates
- Additional Copilot-related sub-sections can be added if relevant for a particular month. Note: Additional thematic sub-sections (e.g., 'Premium Model Usage Controls') can be created within 'Copilot Updates' if the month's news contains a distinct, significant topic that warrants its own heading. Raw notes should ideally indicate such a grouping.
- **Content Format for Announcements**:
  Use a format similar to:
  ```markdown
  -   **[Product Name/Feature Headline] (GA)** – {{One or two sentences describing the release, tailored for leadership/DevOps admin audience.}} - [Descriptive Link Text 1](URL1) | [Descriptive Link Text 2](URL2)
  ```
  *Note on Link Text:* Link text should be descriptive of the link's destination (e.g., 'View the docs', 'Get the Plugin', 'Read the announcement').
    *Example 1 (Feature focused):*
  `*   **Agent Mode (GA)** – Copilot Agent Mode is now generally available, enabling developers to trigger multi-step tasks autonomously such as debugging and running tests. - [Enable Agent mode in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_99#_agent-mode-is-available-in-vs-code-stable) | [Announcement](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-agent-mode-activated/)`
    *Example 2 (Resource focused):*
  `*   **Copilot Adoption at Scale Guide (GA)** – An open-source guide and checklist for rolling out GitHub Copilot across an enterprise, covering best practices and onboarding. - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/samqbush/copilot-adoption?tab=readme-ov-file)`
- **Standard Content for 'Copilot at Scale' (always include):**
    ```markdown
    ### Stay up to date on the latest releases

    - [Eclipse Copilot Changelog](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/github-copilot#details)
    ```

### 2. Webinars, Events, and Recordings
A curated list of relevant upcoming engagements and links to recordings of past events if available.
- Source guidance: Use the Phase 1B events extraction output as input material. For final assembly, enforce the formatting and tone rules here.
- **Standard Content (include if relevant for the month):**
    `Also, watch the [Copilot Fridays back catalog](https://resources.github.com/copilot-fridays-english-on-demand/): Prompt Fundamentals, Copilot for MLOps/Data Science, Copilot for Infrastructure Engineers, GitHub Enterprise Managed Users for Copilot Users`
- **Format for Conference Events (optional)**:
  Only include conference session tables when a major conference occurs in the cycle. Use Date + Time (CT) columns (times converted/presented in Central Time). Example:
  ```markdown
  #### Keynotes
  | Date | Time (CT) | Session | Speakers | Description |
  |------|-----------|---------|----------|-------------|
  | May 19 | 9:05 AM - 10:30 AM | [Session Title](https://example.com) | Speaker Names | Brief description |

  #### Topic Sessions
  | Date | Time (CT) | Session | Description |
  |------|-----------|---------|-------------|
  | May 19 | 11:45 AM - 12:45 PM | [Session Title](https://example.com) | Brief description |
  ```

- **Format for Virtual Events**:
  For all virtual events, strictly use the following table format (no time column; date only):
  ```markdown
  | Date | Event | Categories |
  |------|-------|-----------|
  | May 22 | [Event Title](https://example.com) | Copilot |
  ```

  Categories Rules (apply only canonical categories):
  - Use 0–1 category when fully confident; max 2 only when both clearly apply.
  - Allowed categories: Copilot, GitHub Platform, Developer Experience, Enterprise.
  - Skill level labels (Introductory / Advanced) are omitted unless explicitly required elsewhere (do NOT add inside Categories column).
  - VS Code branded events about AI / productivity implicitly map to Copilot.
  - Security/compliance, indemnity, governance → Enterprise.
  - Prefer a single, broader category over multiple granular ones.

- **Format for In-person Events**:
  For in-person events, use bullet points with location:
  ```markdown
  * City, State - **Month Day** - [Event Name](https://example.com) (add "Hybrid, virtual attendance available" when applicable)
    Brief description (1 sentence, optional)
  ```

Additional rules for this section:
- Virtual events: never show times or time zones—date only.
- Conference session tables (optional): show times converted/presented in CT; if source TZ absent assume CT.
- Hybrid handling: List Hybrid events under In-person with a parenthetical note indicating virtual availability.

Input files (Phase outputs):
- Phase 1A discoveries: `Spaces/Newsletter Space/newsletter_phase1a_discoveries_YYYY-MM-DD_to_YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Phase 1B events: `Spaces/Newsletter Space/newsletter_phase1b_events_YYYY-MM-DD.md`

### 3. Dylan's Corner (Manual – Do NOT auto-generate)
This section is always written manually and should not be produced by automated phases. Insert a placeholder only:
`[Dylan's Corner - Manual content to be added]`

Human authoring guidance (for reference only, not to be auto-generated):
- Conversational, distinct tone
- Focus on a single niche Copilot, compliance, or governance insight
- 1–2 short paragraphs plus optional curated links

### Other Potential Sections (Flexible based on monthly content):
- Security Updates
- DevOps & Integrations (e.g., Azure DevOps, JFrog)
- GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS)
- GitHub Actions
- General Platform Updates
- Learning Resources (if not covered under Copilot at Scale)

## Content Selection Criteria
When deciding what to include:
1.  **Prioritize recency**: Focus on updates from the past month.
2.  **Feature Type Priority**:
    -   **GA features** over preview features when both exist
    -   **IDE feature parity updates** following this pattern: VS Code → Visual Studio → JetBrains → other IDEs (Eclipse, Xcode)
    -   **Administration, governance, and management features**
    -   **Metrics and tools that measure product impact**
    -   **Security, compliance, and risk management**
    -   Then Codebases/Packages/Actions/GHAS features as applicable
3.  **Relevance to Audience**:
    -   Features that appeal to Engineering Managers, DevOps Leads, IT Leadership, and Developers in large, regulated industries.
    -   **Note**: Enterprise customers cannot use Copilot Free/Individual/Pro/Pro+, so avoid mentioning these plans
4.  **Feature Maturity**:
    -   Prioritize `(GA)` features.
    -   Include `(PREVIEW)` features (which encompasses Beta, Experimental, etc.) if they are impactful and relevant, ensuring they are clearly labeled. The goal is to capture customer attention with exciting developments while managing expectations about feature maturity.
5.  **Information Density**:
    -   Emphasize major updates with detailed bullets
    -   Group minor related updates with inline links for conciseness
    -   Create dedicated subsections only for significant topics that require multiple bullets
    -   Balance detail with brevity to maintain readability
  -   Consolidate model rollouts into a single "Model availability updates" bullet (GA first, then PREVIEW)
  -   Ensure Governance / Legal changes (indemnity, preview terms) appear under Copilot at Scale as a dedicated bullet

Each newsletter should balance:
- **New launches** (product updates, roadmap highlights).
- **Metrics & best practices** (ways to measure success, often in "Copilot at Scale").
- **Learning resources** (training materials, certifications, often in "Copilot at Scale" or a dedicated section).
- **Upcoming events** (webinars, conferences, workshops).

---

## Tone & Style
- **Professional but conversational**: Write clearly but with a natural, engaging tone.
- **Maintain a consistent style** across all issues.
- **Personalized for my audience**: Reinforce that the newsletter is specifically curated for large enterprise customers in regulated industries.
- **Strictly avoid em dashes (—)**. Use commas, parentheses, or rephrase the sentence.
- **Use consistent GitHub terminology**: Refer to the `/Reference/GitHub_Common_Jargon.md` file for standard GitHub terminology, product names, and industry-specific language to ensure consistency and authenticity. This helps ground the newsletter in GitHub's ecosystem and makes it resonate with both technical and leadership audiences.

## Call to Action (CTA)
Each newsletter should include clear CTAs:
- Encourage customers to **register for events**.
- Invite feedback and interaction (e.g., "Let me know if you’d like to discuss this in more detail," or use the standard closing).
- Provide direct links to **important resources, documentation, and blog posts**.

## Example Section Format (General Guidance for non-event/Copilot announcement sections)
This is a general template; specific sections like Copilot Announcements and Events have more detailed formats above.
```markdown
**[Section Title]**

**Brief introduction** (1-2 sentences summarizing the key point or theme of the section).
*   **[Item Name/Resource Title] (`(GA)` or `(PREVIEW)`)**: [Concise description of the item and its benefit/relevance to the audience.] ([Link to blog/docs/resource])
*   **[Another Item]**: [Description] ([Link])
```
