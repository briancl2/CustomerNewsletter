# Tone Guidelines

Voice, style, and formatting rules for the final newsletter.

## Voice

- **Personal curator**: The newsletter reads as Brian's personally curated selection, not an automated digest
- **Professional but conversational**: Clear, engaging, natural tone
- **Enterprise-focused**: Write for engineering leaders who care about security, productivity, and governance
- **Practical**: Focus on what's new and why it matters for their teams
- Avoid marketing language; focus on substance

## Audience

- **Primary**: Engineering Managers, DevOps Leads, IT Leadership in large regulated enterprises (Healthcare, Manufacturing, Financial Services)
- **Secondary**: Developers (content appeals to both, but distribution is primarily leadership)

## Formatting Rules

### Always Do
- **Bold** product names, feature names, headlines, dates
- Use **bullet points** for lists of features and resources
- **Embed links** using `[Descriptive Text](URL)` format
- Use proper section headers with `#` hierarchy
- Include `---` dividers between major sections

### Never Do
- Use em dashes. Replace with commas, parentheses, or rephrase.
- Use raw URLs in text
- Use double-bracket links: `[[Text]](URL)` (always single bracket)
- Mention Copilot Free, Individual, Pro, or Pro+ plans
- Include placeholder text (except manual sections if any)
- Use wikilink format

### Release Labels
- Format as `(GA)` or `(PREVIEW)` in uppercase
- Place immediately after feature name in bold text
- List GA before PREVIEW when both exist for same feature
- Omit when release type is ambiguous

## GitHub Terminology

Reference `reference/github_common_jargon.md` for standard product names and terminology. Key terms:
- "GitHub Copilot" (not just "Copilot" in first reference)
- "GitHub Actions" (not "GH Actions")
- "GitHub Advanced Security" or "GHAS"
- "GitHub Enterprise Cloud" or "GHEC"
