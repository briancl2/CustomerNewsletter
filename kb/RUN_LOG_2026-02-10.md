# Run Log - 2026-02-10

## State Header

- **AS_OF_DATE:** 2026-02-10
- **LAST_RUN_DATE:** 2026-02-10

## Chronological Work Log

1. Confirmed runtime date values and initialized run scope.
2. Verified repository workspace state and created `/kb` structure for deliverables.
3. Pulled official Copilot matrix content and confirmed IDE/interface rows (VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains, Eclipse, Xcode, NeoVim).
4. Queried GitHub Docs API/article endpoints for setup pages and cross-surface installation paths.
5. Collected current release/version state for key surfaces:
   - Copilot CLI `v0.0.406` (2026-02-07)
   - Copilot for Xcode `0.47.0` (2026-02-05)
   - VS Code `1.109` release notes (release date 2026-02-04)
   - VS Marketplace Copilot Chat extension `0.38.2026021002` (last updated 2026-02-10)
   - Visual Studio `18.2.1` (2026-01-20)
   - JetBrains plugin `1.5.64-243` (API cdate ~2026-02-05)
   - OpenCode `v1.1.53` (2026-02-05)
6. Verified notable migration/deprecation events:
   - VS Code standalone Copilot extension deprecated in 1.109 notes.
   - `opencode-ai/opencode` archived; active repo is `anomalyco/opencode`.
7. Expanded official surfaces beyond seed via GitHub Docs signals:
   - GitHub Mobile
   - Windows Terminal Canary
   - Azure Data Studio
   - NeoVim (matrix and install docs)
8. Collected framework/tooling metadata for Section B from canonical repos/docs:
   - `gh-aw`, `spec-kit`, `BMAD-METHOD`, `copilot-orchestra`, `loop-agent`, MCP, eval frameworks.
9. Disambiguated `AgentOS` naming collision and retained both major repos with context.
10. Built portability-first best-practices section with `.agents/skills` default policy and explicit platform exceptions.
11. Authored all required markdown deliverables and machine-readable `SOURCES.yaml`.
12. Performed schema sanity checks for `SOURCES.yaml`:
   - 62 source records
   - no missing required fields
   - no duplicate IDs
13. Executed link-health validation across canonical URLs:
   - total unique canonical URLs tested: 68
   - successful (2xx/3xx): 67
   - failures: 1 (Eclipse update site URL, 404)
   - report artifact: `kb/link_health_2026-02-10.tsv`
14. Applied post-comparison patch:
   - added missing official sources for custom-instructions support, response customization, prompt files, OpenCode Copilot support announcement, and legacy metrics API retirement notice.
   - updated OpenCode classification to officially Copilot-supported external surface.
   - updated snapshot and governance text for metrics retirement and customization-source coverage.
15. Revalidated patched source catalog and link health:
   - updated source catalog size: 69 records
   - total unique canonical URLs tested: 76
   - successful (2xx/3xx): 75
   - failures: 1 (Eclipse update site URL, 404)

## Key Decisions

- Chose **MIT** license as permissive default for docs-focused repository.
- Treated `.agents/skills` as the reusable default location per portability requirement.
- Kept `.github/instructions` references as legacy/platform-specific context only.
- Treated OpenCode as an **officially Copilot-supported external surface** based on GitHub Changelog announcement, while keeping OpenCode product docs/releases labeled community-managed.
- Included additional official surfaces (mobile, terminal, Azure Data Studio, NeoVim) because they appeared in official docs/matrix.

## Exclusions

- Did not include unsupported monthly/yearly RRULE automation content (not part of requested KB artifact set).
- Did not treat unverified blog/opinion links as canonical unless operationally concrete and explicitly practitioner-labeled.

## Ambiguities Encountered

1. **OpenCode source split:** GitHub confirms Copilot support in changelog, but OpenCode release/docs truth lives on community-managed channels.
2. **AgentOS naming:** multiple active repositories use the same name with different goals.
3. **Feature matrix vs marketplace drift:** matrix latest-release rows can lag current release channels.

## Broken Links / Moving Targets

- `https://azuredownloads-g3ahgwb5b8bkbxhd.b01.azurefd.net/github-copilot/`
  - Status on 2026-02-10: HTTP 404
  - Source ID: `eclipse_copilot_update_site`
  - Action: retained with `stability: low` and explicit warning in snapshot/section A.

## Validation Checklist Results

- **Completeness:** PASS (required surfaces covered; additional official surfaces included).
- **Canonicality:** PASS with caveat (OpenCode support announcement is GitHub-official, but OpenCode release/docs channels remain community-managed).
- **Feeds:** PASS (RSS/Atom/API included where available).
- **Dedupe:** PASS (deduplicated source records by stream identity).
- **Portability:** PASS (`.agents/skills` default + explicit exceptions).
- **Matrix linkage:** PASS (matrix anchor plus feature-area mapping to docs/update streams).
- **Link health:** PASS with one recorded failure (Eclipse update site 404).

## Gaps and Unknowns

- No robust machine-readable feed found for Eclipse marketplace updates.
- No dedicated machine-readable feed found for Copilot updates specific to GitHub Mobile or Windows Terminal Canary.

## Recommended Next Iteration Goals

1. Add automated feed polling and delta generation from `SOURCES.yaml`.
2. Add automatic matrix-vs-channel drift checks for IDE version tables.
3. Revalidate Eclipse update site and locate any replacement endpoint.
4. Add surfaced-change severity tags for newsletter triage.
