Brian's June Newsletter: Copilot Champions user list, JFrog Partnership, MSBuild Updates & Copilot Extensions Launch

This is a personally curated newsletter for just my customers. The purpose is to pull together and share current resources, announcements, and events. I welcome your feedback, and please let me know if you would like to add or remove anyone from this list.

Highlights for June are Copilot Champions, JFrog Partnership, MSBuild Highlights & Copilot Extensions Beta Launch.

## Measuring the impact of GitHub Copilot - Copilot Champions
Last month I shared a number of resources to access GitHub’s Metrics API public beta. For July, I invite my Copilot customers to engage with the data in a deeper way through a few options:
- (EMU accounts only) Request your Copilot Champions list of power users. For accounts on Enterprise Managed Users (EMU), GitHub can provide two additional data points not accessible via API. These data points identify your top Copilot users to assist with training the rest of the user base on what is working well, tips and tricks, prompt engineering, etc. Some companies may choose to ask for volunteers amongst your Copilot Champions to host Lunch and Learns or staff regular office hours depending on the needs of your newer Copilot users that are still learning how to get the most out of the product. To request your organization’s list of Copilot Champions, reply to this email.

- If you aren’t already running regular surveys of your developer population to collect real-world data, automate Copilot developer surveys using this [public repo](https://github.com/github/copilot-survey-engine)

## GitHub and JFrog partner to unify code and binaries for DevSecOps
Together with JFrog, we’ve built an integration that includes intuitive navigation and traceability between source code and binaries, CI/CD with GitHub Actions and JFrog Artifactory, and a unified view of security findings across the software supply chain.

With this new integration, we’ve integrated SSO, project role mapping and access management, and CI integration across both platforms. With centralized user IAM, users won’t need to worry about multiple logins, and changes made on one platform will automatically propagate to the other.

## Microsoft Build Updates for GitHub
Microsoft Build conference was held a few weeks ago, and there were a number of GitHub related announcements and sessions. 
- **NEW** Copilot Extensions announced during Satya Nadella’s [Build Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OviTSFqucI). Imagine you’re a developer who just got paged for a database-related incident. You’re trying to get context of the issue from a variety of tools such as a GitHub issue or audit logs in [DataStax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SmjSKsBRNk). With enough context, you start troubleshooting using tools like [Sentry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irRaA4OZpGM) for error monitoring to learn more. Then you can figure out a solution, apply the fix, and deploy with [Azure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf9zqtxbI9c) or [Octopus Deploy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO6fRiZwhCI). With the recently announced Copilot Extensions, you can do all of this within GitHub Copilot Chat without context switching. See more at the launch [blog post](https://github.blog/2024-05-21-introducing-github-copilot-extensions/). Additional resources:
